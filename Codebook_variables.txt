CODEBOOK DESCRIBING VARIABLES

Variables in the cleaned up dataset prior to averaging by activities and participants:

All columns but the final two are descriptively named after the features provided by the 'features.txt' file.
They represent variables extracted from biometric sensor data captured by the participants' wearables.

The second last column (named 'activities') contains descriptive labels of the activities participants were engaging in during this data collection.
Eg. 'WALKING', 'SITTING'. 

The final column contains data on the subjects whose data were collected. This column is named 'subjects' and goes from 1 to 30, covering the number of participants. 



Variables in final dataset are:

Column 1: subjects; containing the integers 1-30 representing separate participants.
Column 2: activities; labelled descriptively as 'LAYING', 'SITTING' etc.
Remaining columns: labelled by appropriate feature, and containing the average value for that feature as a function of participant and activity.
